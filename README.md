# Twitter Degree of Separation

This code gets all the users and their respective followers. This code requires that you have a twitter account and driver for selenium. A list and dictionary is returned. The list contains all of the users and the dictionary returns a user as the key and their followers as the value. To allow for faster page loading, the driver does not load images for the twitter accounts. The 'follower_thres' of the get_users function allows you to set a threshold and if a user has a follower count higher than then that, their account is skipped. This was implemented because the code web scrapes through web automation and account with alot of followers will take too long. The 'max_nodes' of the node function of the DOS class allows you set the node count (length of the list) which will stop the code.
